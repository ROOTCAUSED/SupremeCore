VoteWeather|voteTime refactors. This should allow a new vote object to be created om command
exectuition rather than on startup. This will allow multiple simultaneous votes to be held across different worlds of the same server.

To do -
    Change constructor on TV/WV objects to accept parameters including world.
    - https://github.com/fof1092/WeatherVote/blob/master/src/me/F_o_F_1092/WeatherVote/WeatherVote.java does this quite well.

TitleSender - Will need to rework the custom title library for SS. Experiment with various styling differences. Would be nice to get a nice gradient going.

MYSQLConnector - Ensure compatibility with mariadb (shouldnt be an issue, but have had other plugins not work with MDB)

GoldLimiter - Look into tying into EssxAPI in order to listen for the sell event and intercept, cancelling the event
if the user has already met their daily quota. This will likely need a database table GoldTxns24hr or similar.
